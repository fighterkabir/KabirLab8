### Graceful Degradation & Service Workers:
The relationship between these two concepts makes perfect sense.
Graceful degradation is all about creating software that makes the most
out of all the technology available, but when some of that technology fails, or isn't
available, still having the application function properly. As such, service workers can 
be thought of as a crucial tool in the arsenal of **implementing** graceful degradation.
Since service workers are meant to make your application retain functionality in the face
of a network outage, your application can gracefully degrade by showing the user features
of your app that were saved in cache. Thus, your application isn't so heavily dependent on 
an internet connection to function and can therefore reach more people that have mabye
on average a worse connection or a lower-end device.
